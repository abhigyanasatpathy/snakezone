State Management with useState: Utilized useState hook to manage the state of the snake's position, food coordinates, direction, game speed, and game over condition.

Effect Handling with useEffect: Employed useEffect hook to manage game logic, including snake movement, keyboard input handling, collision detection, and game over conditions.

Ref Handling with useRef: Utilized useRef hook to create references for audio elements to play eat and game over sounds.

Random Coordinates Generation: Implemented a function to generate random coordinates for placing food within the game area.

Keyboard Input Handling: Captured arrow key presses to change the snake's direction of movement.

Collision Detection: Checked for collisions between the snake's head and its body segments or the game area boundaries to determine game over conditions.

Dynamic Rendering: Dynamically rendered the snake, food, and game area components based on state changes.

Game Over Handling: Triggered game over conditions when the snake's length reached a specific value or upon collision with itself or game boundaries.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
